# QUID
Molecular dimers data in QUID.h5 file. For each dimer label, e.g. 'F1B1', the atom types and their positions are stored under the labels 'formula' and 'positions' with a further 'monomer_split' containing the number of the dimer atoms belonging to its big and small monomer in that order. Three further types of information are stored - interaction energies, SAPT components, and other physicochemical properties with the labels 'Eint', 'SAPT', and 'properties'. The properties were generated at PBE0 or PBE0+MBD level, and van der Waals atomic force components at PBE0 +MBD, +D4, and +XDM levels . The interaction energies and forces are provided in eV and eV/Ã…, with further details avaiable in Table S3 for the interaction energies and Table S4 for the properties of the SI of "Extending quantum-mechanical benchmark accuracy to biological ligand-pocket interactions".
