# QUID
Molecular dimers data in QUID.h5 file. For each dimer label, e.g. 'F1B1', the chemical dimer formula is available under the key 'formula', while atomic numbers and their positions for 'dimer', 'big_monomer', and 'small_monomer' are stored under the labels 'atoms' and 'positions'. Three further types of information are stored - interaction energies, SAPT components, and other physicochemical properties with the labels 'Eint', 'SAPT', and 'properties'. The properties were generated at PBE0 or PBE0+MBD level, and van der Waals atomic force components at PBE0 +MBD, +D4, and +XDM levels. The information for the non-equilibrium dimers can be found under the main key ‘dissociation’ with the number to the dimer name indicating its location along the dissociation curve. The interaction energies and forces are provided in eV and eV/Å, with further details avaiable in Table S3 for the interaction energies and Table S4 for the properties of the SI of "Extending quantum-mechanical benchmark accuracy to biological ligand-pocket interactions".
