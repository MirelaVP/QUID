# QUID
Molecular dimers data in QUID.h5 file. For each dimer label, e.g. 'F1B1', the atom types and their positions are stored under the labels 'formula' and 'positions' with a further 'monomer_split' containing the number of the dimer atoms belonging to its big and small monomer in that order. Three further types of information are stored - interaction energies, SAPT components, and other physicochemical properties (generated at PBE0+MBD level) with the labels 'energies', 'SAPT', and 'properties'. The interaction energies are provided in kcal/mol, while further details on the properties is avaiable in Fig. of the SI of "Extending quantum-mechanical benchmark accuracy to biological ligand-pocket interactions".
